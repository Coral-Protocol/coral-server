The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

      "long_description": "Weak coin flipping is among the fundamental cryptographic primitives which ensure the security of modern communication networks. It allows two mistrustful parties to remotely agree on a random bit when they favor opposite outcomes. Unlike other two-party computations, one can achieve information-theoretic security using quantum mechanics only: both parties are prevented from biasing the flip with probability higher than $1/2+\\ensuremath{\\epsilon}$, where $\\ensuremath{\\epsilon}$ is arbitrarily low. Classically, the dishonest party can always cheat with probability 1 unless computational assumptions are used. Despite its importance, no physical implementation has been proposed for quantum weak coin flipping. Here, we present a practical protocol that requires a single photon and linear optics only. We show that it is fair and balanced even when threshold single-photon detectors are used, and reaches a bias as low as $\\ensuremath{\\epsilon}=1/\\sqrt{2}\\ensuremath{-}1/2\\ensuremath{\\approx}0.207$.

      "long_description": "The origin and phenomenology of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) remains unknown despite more than a decade of efforts. Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observa",

      "long_description": "Since the discovery of the first fast radio burst (FRB) in 2007, and their confirmation as an abundant extragalactic population in 2013, the study of these sources has expanded at an incredible rate. In our 2019 review on the subject we presented a growing, but still mysterious, population of FRBs -- 60 unique sources, 2 repeating FRBs, and only 1 identified host galaxy. However, in only a few short years new observations and discoveries have given us a wealth of information about these sources. The total FRB population now stands at over 600 published sources, 24 repeaters, and 19 host galaxies. Higher time resolution data, sustained monitoring, and precision localisations have given us insight into repeaters, host galaxies, burst morphology, source activity, progenitor models, and the use of FRBs as cosmological probes. The recent detection of a bright FRB-like burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR~1935+2154 provides an important link between FRBs and magnetars. There also continue to be surprising discoveri",

Tolkien trilogy and all its characters. However, when he recalled the voice of Gollum, he assigned a different obsession to the dual personality character than the “one ring to rule them all.” “Gollum was on the side and Sméagol was on this side,” Serkis explained. “And he would say things like, “We wants it. We needs it. We must have Kyiv!’ ‘No Precious, they're to impose sanctions!’ ‘Sanctions? Sanctions, my Precious? If they do anything, we're going to give them s*** back.’” Serkis was referring to the sanctions that are being imposed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, and the actor likened the evil Gollum to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking of sanctions, apparently Andy’s newest film ,The Batman, is being used to promote peace in Eastern Europe. “There's so much anticipation for this movie right now, th",

      "long_description": "Any good fairy tale needs a knight in shining armor, a strong princess and a big scary dragon. They need a castle or two nestled away in the mountains and alternating lands of forest and open plains that they can fulfill quests and interact with each other in. And they need a story. Something that flows and allows us to see their adventures and experience it alongside of them. Something that crosses their paths and plans and weaves a tapestry before our very eyes. Every good fairy tale will bring that and more. But what if we could take the best things in gaming and smash it together with a legitimate story and play it out? Enter in Fairy Tile, and you can have all the best parts of a story wrapped into a game come to life on your table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFairy Tile is a new game from iello games, designed by Matthew Dunstan and Brett J Gilbert with illustrations from Miguel Coimbra and graphic design by LowKey. The game plays 2-4 players at 30 minutes and is recommended for ages 8 and up. \r\n\r\nComponents:\r\n\r\nFairy Tile ",
