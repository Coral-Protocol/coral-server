Eventually, that journey led me to photography as a way to share stories about the beauty and fragility of our natural world.\n\nNow, I’m honored to be part of a cohort of 15 inspiring young leaders joining the National Geographic Explorer community - working together to tackle challenges, seek solutions, and build a better future. \n\nI’m especially excited to continue telling stories that highlight California’s incredible biodiversity with the support of The National Geographic Society.\n\nMany thanks to the family, friends, mentors, and collaborators who have supported me throughout this ",

For every editor feature, say errors and warnings (linting), we had to extend our development protocol with a set of commands and data structures, and then teach our development containers how to wrap the given tool, say Pylint, and our frontend on how to consume it (say annotate the editor with errors and warnings). A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades -- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume.\n\nHowever, this is about to change: a couple of years ago, Microsoft's VS Code team announced \"A Common Protocol for Languages\", a single all-encompassing protocol that provides general-purpose",
