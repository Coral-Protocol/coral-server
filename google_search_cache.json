      "long_description": "The Poisonous Birds of New Guinea (& Stories of Fieldwork in New Guinea)\nDr. Jack Dumbacher, Curator and Chair of Ornithology and Mammalogy \n\nNew Guinea is a tropical island roughly the size of Texas and just north of Australia, but it is home to some of the most spectacular birds in the world, including Birds of Paradise, giant cassowaries, tiny pygmy parrots, and of course birds that are poisonous. Its rugged environment is unwelcoming to explorers, but for those who make the effort, it is magically beautiful and full of scientific surprises. Jack Dumbacher has studied birds in New Guinea since the early 1990s, and he will talk about his research and fieldwork on New Guinea's poisonous birds—the hooded and variable pitohuis and the blue-capped ifrita.\n\n- - -\n\n🙌 Now More Than Ever, We Need Your Support. \nThe Academy’s critical work continues even while our museum doors remain closed.

Directly evaluating molecular complexity could be used to study directed vs undirected processes in the creation of molecules, with potential applications in drug discovery, the origin of life, and artificial life. Assembly theory has been developed to quantify the complexity of a molecule by finding the shortest path to construct the molecule from building blocks, revealing its molecular assembly index (MA). In this study, we present an approach to rapidly infer the MA of molecules from  spectroscopic measurements. We demonstrate that the MA can be experimentally measured by using three independent techniques: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and infrared spectroscopy (IR). By identifying and analyzing the number of absorbances in IR spectra, carbon resonances in NMR, or molecular fragments in tandem MS, the MA of an unknown",

Directly evaluating molecular complexity could be used to study directed vs undirected processes in the creation of molecules, with potential applications in drug discovery, the origin of life, and artificial life. Assembly theory has been developed to quantify the complexity of a molecule by finding the shortest path to construct the molecule from building blocks, revealing its molecular assembly index (MA). In this study, we present an approach to rapidly infer the MA of molecules from  spectroscopic measurements. We demonstrate that the MA can be experimentally measured by using three independent techniques: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and infrared spectroscopy (IR). By identifying and analyzing the number of absorbances in IR spectra, carbon resonances in NMR, or molecular fragments in tandem MS, the MA of an unknown",

As a child, watching documentaries and reading stories from National Geographic helped spark my passion for wildlife - and inspired me to explore California in search of the species that first captured my imagination. Eventually, that journey led me to photography as a way to share stories about the beauty and fragility of our natural world.\n\nNow, I’m honored to be part of a cohort of 15 inspiring young leaders joining the National Geographic Explorer community - working together to tackle challenges, seek solutions, and build a better future. \n\nI’m especially excited to continue telling stories that highlight California’s incredible biodiversity with the support of The National Geographic Society.\n\nMany thanks to the family, friends, mentors, and collaborators who have supported me throughout this ",

For every editor feature, say errors and warnings (linting), we had to extend our development protocol with a set of commands and data structures, and then teach our development containers how to wrap the given tool, say Pylint, and our frontend on how to consume it (say annotate the editor with errors and warnings). A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades -- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume.\n\nHowever, this is about to change: a couple of years ago, Microsoft's VS Code team announced \"A Common Protocol for Languages\", a single all-encompassing protocol that provides general-purpose",
