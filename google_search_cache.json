      "long_description": "Empirical evidence suggests that social structure may have changed from hierarchical to egalitarian and back along the evolutionary line of humans. We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical",

      "long_description": "Advanced AI models hold the promise of tremendous benefits for humanity, but society needs to proactively manage the accompanying risks. In this paper, we focus on what we term \"frontier AI\" models: highly capable foundation models that could possess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety. Frontier AI models pose a distinct regulatory challenge: dangerous capabilities can arise unexpectedly; it is difficult to robustly prevent a deployed model from being misused; and, it is difficult to stop a model's capabilities from proliferating broadly. To address these challenges, at least three building blocks for the regulation of frontier models are needed: (1) standard-setting processes to identify appropriate requirements for frontier AI developers, (2) registration and reporting requirements to provide regulators with visibility into frontier AI development processes, and (3) mechanisms to ensure compliance with safety standards for the development and deployment of frontier AI mod",

      "long_description": "Empirical evidence suggests that social structure may have changed from hierarchical to egalitarian and back along the evolutionary line of humans. We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical",

      "long_description": "Empirical evidence suggests that social structure may have changed from hierarchical to egalitarian and back along the evolutionary line of humans. We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical",

Pythons compete with native wildlife for food, which includes mammals, birds, and other reptiles. Severe declines in mammal populations throughout Everglades National Park have been linked to Burmese pythons, with the most severe declines in native species having occurred in the remote southernmost regions of the Park where pythons have been established the longest. A 2012 study found that populations of raccoons had declined 99.3 percent, opossums 98.9 percent, and bobcats 87.5 percent since 1997 (Mammal Decline).

      "long_description": "Advanced AI models hold the promise of tremendous benefits for humanity, but society needs to proactively manage the accompanying risks. In this paper, we focus on what we term \"frontier AI\" models: highly capable foundation models that could possess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety. Frontier AI models pose a distinct regulatory challenge: dangerous capabilities can arise unexpectedly; it is difficult to robustly prevent a deployed model from being misused; and, it is difficult to stop a model's capabilities from proliferating broadly. To address these challenges, at least three building blocks for the regulation of frontier models are needed: (1) standard-setting processes to identify appropriate requirements for frontier AI developers, (2) registration and reporting requirements to provide regulators with visibility into frontier AI development processes, and (3) mechanisms to ensure compliance with safety standards for the development and deployment of frontier AI mod",

      "long_description": "Current proposals for AI regulation, in the EU and beyond, aim to spur AI that is trustworthy (e.g., AI Act) and accountable (e.g., AI Liability) What is missing, however, is a robust regulatory discourse and roadmap to make AI, and technology more broadly, environmentally sustainable. This paper aims to take first steps to fill this gap. The ICT sector contributes up to 3.9 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-more than global air travel at 2.5 percent. The carbon footprint and water consumption of AI, especially large-scale generative models like GPT-4, raise significant sustainability concerns. The paper is the first to assess how current and proposed technology regulations, including EU environmental law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the AI Act, could be adjusted to better account for environmental sustainability. The GDPR, for instance, could be interpreted to limit certain individual rights like the right to erasure if these rights significantly conflict with broader su",

      "long_description": "Empirical evidence suggests that social structure may have changed from hierarchical to egalitarian and back along the evolutionary line of humans. We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical",

      "long_description": "Empirical evidence suggests that social structure may have changed from hierarchical to egalitarian and back along the evolutionary line of humans. We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical",

      "long_description": "Empirical evidence suggests that social structure may have changed from hierarchical to egalitarian and back along the evolutionary line of humans. We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical",

      "long_description": "Empirical evidence suggests that social structure may have changed from hierarchical to egalitarian and back along the evolutionary line of humans. We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical",

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 17 new SPFMV genomes all fitted within either major phylogroup A, minor phylogroup II, formerly O; or major phylogroup B, formerly RC.

The samples were planted in the glasshouse and scions obtained from the plants were graft inoculated to Ipomoea setosa plants. Virus symptoms were recorded in the field in Kununurra and in glasshouse-grown sweetpotato and I. setosa plants. RNA extracts from I. setosa leaf samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing. New complete SPFMV (n = 17) and SPVC (n = 6) genomic sequences were obtained and compared with 47 sequences from GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 17 new SPFMV genomes all fitted within either major phylogroup A, minor phylogroup II, formerly O; or major phylogroup B, formerly RC. Major phylogroup A’s minor phylogroup I, formerly EA, only appeared when recombinants were included. Numbers of SPVC genomes were insufficient to sub",

For the first time, you could share a URL with a friend, student, or coworker and get a shared text editor and runtime — no setup required. Replit Multiplayer is changing how an entire generation of programmers learn how to code and make software.\n\nToday, we're announcing Ghostwriter, which infuses state-of-the-art intelligence into nearly all IDE features. Ghostwriter sports an ML-powered pair programmer that completes your code in realtime, tools to generate, transform, and explain code, and an in-editor search utility that lets you find and import open-source code without leaving your editor (think Stackoverflow in your editor).",

(170.8 x 108 cm)  This celebrated portait--one of El Greco's greatest--probably shows Niño de Guevara, who was made cardinal in 1596 and archbishop of Seville in 1601.  Philip III appointed him to the Consejo Real and Inquistor General; as such he had charge of the Inquisition, and was forced to resign the post in 1602.  As Inquisitor General, Guevara was in Toledo in February and March 1600, and visted the city again in 1601 and 1604.  This potrait would have been painted on one of these occasions.  Alternatively, the portrait has been identified as Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, cardinal archbishop of Toledo (1546-1618) and a dedicated church reformer, patron of the arts, and Guevara's successor as Inquisitor General (1608).  Recent research into the provenance of the painting makes this identification less likely.  H. O. Havem",
